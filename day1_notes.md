Reflection
Today I successfully solved 10 basic problems.

I faced difficulty in the 10th problem because I wasn’t sure how to compare the operator and then perform the correct operation. I also forgot the approach of fixing one number as the largest and then comparing it with the others.

Suggestions
Before jumping straight into coding, it’s better to pause for a few minutes, think through the logic, and decide on one clear approach. This makes solving the problem much easier and avoids confusion later.
